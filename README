I wrote codes for the following methods used in Optimisation Techniques.

1) Simplex Method
2) Big-M Method
3) 2 Phase Method

I had an introductiory course in Optimisation Techniques(MA305) in my 3rd year.
I wrote algorithms for most general cases but there are always some exceptions so let me know if you find one while using this.
The script files can be used for demonstration or for actual problem solving.
